            <h2>Why Read and Write?</h2>
            <p>Being able to read and write are some of the most important skills that you’ll ever learn.
               Sure, you need to be able to read and write well to get good grades, but being able to read and write opens up so many different worlds to you!
            </p>
            <h3>Books</h3>

                <figure> <!-- Put the images into containers so that I can put the image credits underneath them easily and also assist screen readers. -->

                <p>Being able to read can take you to different places! Imagine opening up a book and reading about a cat wearing a funny hat and the silly things that he gets up to! 
                    What about a boy and a talking tree? A brave knight on a quest to save the princess from an evil monster? Books can take us all kinds of places!

            <p>There are many video games out there that need you to be able to read in order to figure out how to move forward in them. 
                Being able to read lets you follow the stories, figure out what characters are saying, and even get through menus! 
                Without reading, you may end up missing out on a lot from your favorite game.
            </p>
            <h3>But Why Learn It?</h3>
            <p>While it’s nice to be able to enjoy things like books and video games, you can also create your own work such as a story or a comic book by knowing how to read and write. This lets you show off your creativity and make something fun for others to enjoy! 
                These skills also help in the grown up world when you end up working a job and have to talk to people a lot!
